Designed and developed a self-stabilizing spoon system, including embedded control logic and a 3D-modeled mechanical structure, intended to assist individuals with hand tremors.

The project involved researching tremor behavior, designing stabilization concepts, developing embedded code, and creating a 3D model to represent the physical implementation. Emphasis was placed on control logic, system design, and feasibility.

This project received 1st Runner Up in the Physics category at KVRSS India, recognizing its technical design and real-world applicability.
